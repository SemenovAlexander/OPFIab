# OPFIab
OPFIab is a next step from [OpenIAB](https://github.com/onepf/OpenIAB). It's an Android library intended to make in-app billing integration easy while supporting multiple billing providers (Appstores).

**This library is still under development and may contain bugs. Any feedback is deeply appreciated.**

## Dependencies
Library is designed to be extensible and cosists of separate modules.

Add core dependency:
```groovy
  dependencies {
    compile 'de.greenrobot:eventbus:2.4.0'
    compile 'org.onepf:opfutils:0.1.22'
    compile 'org.onepf:opfiab:0.2.1@aar'
  }
```
Or grab our latest [release](https://github.com/onepf/OPFIab/releases).

You'll also whant to add one or few `BillingProvider` modules. Check [supported providers](https://github.com/onepf/OPFIab/wiki#supported-billing-providers) for details.

## FAQ
####How is this library different from [OpenIAB](https://github.com/onepf/OpenIAB)? Why should I bother migrating?

OPFIab is an attempt to implement universal, extensible billing library that OpenIAB should've been from the start.

Unfortunately OpenIAB has some fundamental flaws.

It carries heavy burden of legacy architecture from Google's IabHelper it was initially based on. It adopted unfinished concept of OpenStores and encapsulated a lot of different app stores in one bundle which made it really difficult to maintain.

Most notable advantages for using OPFIab:
* **Moduled architecture** One appstore - one module. Use only modules you need. It's easy to extend existing modules and change their behaviour if you need to.
* **Straightforward library configuration** It should only be setup once and preferably from `Application#onCreate` since this is the only code guaranteed to be executed if app was started from `BroadcastReceiver`.
* **Simple listeners API** Library offers one global listener to handle all billing event which is useful to save persistent changes (DataBase, SharedPreferences etc.) as well as dynamic listeners intended to simplify UI updates.
* Overall better quality code with more android-friendly architecture and less concurrency pitfalls.
